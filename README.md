Based engine is a 2D game engine written in C++ using SDL2 based on Birch Engine made by Let's Make Games's C++ SDL2 video series. It's an ongoing project and I will be working on it regularly.

The assets in the asset folder are for a simple demo as of now and are not necessary for the engine to run. They will be replaced by proper demo assets that demonstrate the engine better;

## Todo

- [ ] Finish the item and weapon classes
- [ ] Make GUIs for the inventory and pause menu
- [ ] Enemy AI presets (walking enemy, ranged enemy, boss, etc)
- [ ] Irregular shape colliders
- [ ] Create a VC++ branch (This may become the main branch cus I like Visual studio for C++ more than VS code)

## Use Requirements

Make

g++

SDL2 libraries (Image, Mixer, Fonts)

C++ IDE [^1]

[^1]: I Use vscode which is recommended. The project is not currently setup for Visual studio so it may not work as a VC++ project but I will migrate to VC++ in the future. Visual studio should work as a IDE as long as you use the included makefile to build and not MSCV.

## How to Use

Clone the Repository into a folder and begin editing code to fit your games needs.

VS Code is reccomended for easy quick editing.
Notepad++ is a valid option as a lite editor.
